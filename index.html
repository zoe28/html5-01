          The country is divided into 47 prefectures in eight regions, with Hokkaido being the northernmost prefecture and
          Okinawa being the southernmost one. The population of 127 million is the world's tenth largest. Japanese people

          <em>The Japanese tea ceremony</em> is a comprehensive art with a Zen influence. The cups and utensils for the tea and
          the tea room are beautiful and have a sublime atmosphere, reflecting the intention of welcoming and offering hospitality
          to guests. Etiquette is required on the part of both the host and the guests, and they are intended to enjoy communicating
          with each other according to such etiquette.
